  Mission2 RGB LED Control

  The Red, Green and Blue LED blink one by one. The delay between each flash is 1s.

  The circuit:
  - Connect the anode (long leg) of each LED to digital pins D16, D17 and D18 (via a 1k ohm resistor).
  - Connect the cathodes (short leg) to the SwiftIO’s ground.

  Add more LEDs to your circuit. Don’t forget the current-limiting resistors. 
  You will need to declare the new pins in your code and set them all to OUTPUT. 
  Try to simulate traffic light logic. This example code is in the public domain.
