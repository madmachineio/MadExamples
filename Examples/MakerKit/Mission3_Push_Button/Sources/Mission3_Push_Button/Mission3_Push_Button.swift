  Mission3 Push Button

  The Red LED will be turned on when you press the button.

  The circuit:
  - Use Button Module, and connect it to a Digital Jack. 
  - When the Arduino Sheild is properly plugged in, the LED will be on.

  Each time the input pin goes from LOW to HIGH (e.g. because of a push-button press), the
  output pin is toggled from LOW to HIGH or HIGH to LOW. There's a minimum delay between toggles
  to debounce the circuit (i.e. to ignore noise). Try solve the issue. This example code is in the public domain.
