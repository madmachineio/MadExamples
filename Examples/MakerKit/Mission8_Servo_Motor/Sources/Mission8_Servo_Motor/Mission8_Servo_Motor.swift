/*
  Mission8 Servo Motor

  Turn the potentiometer and the angle of servo arm will change.

  The circuit:
  - Use Potentiometer Module and connect it to an Analog Jack.
  - Most servo motors have the following three connections: 
    Black/Brown ground wire. 
    Red power wire (around 3.3V). 
    Yellow or White PWM wire.
  - In this mission, we will connect the power and ground pins directly to the SwiftIO 3.3V and GND pins. 
  - The PWM input will be connected to one of the SwiftIO's digital output pins.

  Try to change the servo's movement to an opposite way.
  Or, use a light sensor instead of the potentiometer. Then you reads how much light is present! 
  This example code is in the public domain.

            let pulse = Int(500 + 2000 * value) // Calculate the value to get the pulse duration.
            servo.set(period: 20000, pulse: pulse) // Set the servo position according to the scaled value.
