  You should see a number "6" on the 7-segment display.

  The circuit:
  - Connect the 7-segment display into the Arduino Sheild.
  - Note: 7-segment display consists of 7 LEDs, called segments, arranged in the shape of an “8”. 
    Most 7-segment displays actually have 8 segments, with a dot on the right side of the digit 
    that serves as a decimal point.
